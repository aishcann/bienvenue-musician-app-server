# BienVenue - An App for Gigging Musicians

BienVenue is an app that aims to solve a common problem that touring and gigging musicians have when booking their own shows: finding the best venues to perform at and accurate contact information for bookers at these venues. The app will build a database of music venues across the world, which users can constantly refer to when in search of reputable venues. BienVenue is meant to be a central hub for DIY musicians booking their own gigs.
